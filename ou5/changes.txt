Changes for OU5, DoA LP4 2020.

Author:	Elias Olofsson (tfy17eon@cs.umu.se)

Version information:
  v1.0 2020-06-05: First public version.
		   
  v2.0 2020-06-13: Fixed a bug in the graph datastructure implementation graph.c 
		   where the code would traverse past the end of the node_array 
		   if the array was fully populated. The affected functions are 
		   graph_insert_node(), graph_find_node(), graph_reset_seen(), 
		   graph_insert_edge(), graph_neighbours() and graph_kill(). 
		   The same fix has been applied to all the mentioned functions.
		   
		   The report has been complemented by a pseudo-code of the 
		   breadth-first search algorithm in sec.(4).
